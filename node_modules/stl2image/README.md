# stl2image

This library is a fork of https://github.com/cubehero/stljs.

The main objective is  to allow you to export stl (stereolitography) to images using pov-ray


Note: Currently, the readFile works for both binary and ascii files, but writing
STL files is only in ASCII

This currently only works on node.js, but will expand to browser stl parsing soon

## How to install

````
npm install stl2image
````

You need to have installed on your system [Pov-ray ](http://povray.org) (tested for >=3.6)

If you're on a mac, you can install it using homebrew.

````
brew install povray
````

If you're using ubuntu, you can install it using aptitude

````
aptitude install povray
````

In Windows, you can download and binary installable from Pov-Ray website.

## Converting STL to PNG

Sometimes, you want to convert an STL file into a PNG file. To do that, we can 

````
stl2image = require('stljs')

stl2image.imageify('teapot.stl', { width: 200, height: 100, dst: 'teapot.png' }
  , (err, povOutput, name) ->
    # done with converting the image
  , (err, povPolygon, name) -> 
    # called on each polygon is processed
)
````

NOTE: In order to use this feature, you need to have pov-ray installed on your system
already. This can be installed separately through 'aptitude' on linux and 'brew'
on macs
